- Hi, I'm Yuting Shen, a junior student currently studying Computer Science in Georgia Tech.

- I'm interested in software development. 
  I established three application projects (one for Android development, and two for iOS development.)
  For the projects, I use Java, Kotlin, and Swift. I also adopted MVC and MVVM methods in the development.
  
- I'm also interested in low level of the computer. I work with assemble language as well as C.
  I have two projects that demonstrate some basic concepts of the computer (page replacement and scheduling).
  It's really fun to learn how the computer processes the information and turn the bit numbers into more complex data.
