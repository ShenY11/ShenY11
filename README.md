- Hi, I'm Yuting Shen, a Master's CS student at GeorgiaTech.
  
- ### My research interest:
  - ML4Astro (the interdisciplinary part of Machine Learning and Astrophysics).
    -   As massive data are going to be sent back from different sources, how can we utilize these data and take astrophysics to a new level?
    -   How machine learning models can be used for astro research?
  - Large Scale Structure.
  - Galaxy formation.

- ### My skills:
  -   I'm familiar with Python, JavaScript, Java, and SQL.
  -   I also have experience in industrial frameworks like React, and React Native.

- I'm a good team player and I'm looking for research opportunities. Hit me up if you have any questions or if you want to collaborate.

Thank you!
